      <description>I made an account on Orkut in 2009. In those days an internet connection was expensive and slow. Luckily, one of my uncles moved into our house for a while because he got a job in the city as a PhP developer. He had a PC that I could use. Most people around me didn&amp;rsquo;t have any virtual social presence, and no one was bombarded with an insane amount of curated and unnecessary information.</description>
