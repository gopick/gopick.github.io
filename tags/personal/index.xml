      <description>It has been 5 years since I started working. I still work at Goldman, although I don&amp;rsquo;t work with data anymore. I do App development now. In a truly agile way (A 5 year sprint? Don&amp;rsquo;t hire me as your scrum master), I have decided to write a retrospective. What went well? What did not go so well? What could be better? But more importantly, what did I learn?
Before I started working, life was like sprinting on a track.</description>

      <description>I made an account on Orkut in 2009. In those days, internet connections were expensive and (super)slow. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have my own pc, but luckily, one of my uncles got a job in the city as a PhP developer. He stayed with us for a few years and he had a PC that I could use. Most people around me didnâ€™t have any virtual social presence. And no one was bombarded with an insane amount of curated and unnecessary information like we are today.</description>
