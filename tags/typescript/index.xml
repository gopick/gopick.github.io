      <description>This was a great weekend read. I was familiar with most of the concepts introduced in this course, but it was great to have them introduced in more formal way. The course uses typescript, and I finally got some exposure to it. Maybe as a next step I should use it to build something - something for the future. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great course for people just joining the workforce as software devs.</description>
