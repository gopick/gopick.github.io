      <description>I made an account on Orkut in 2009. In those days an internet connection was expensive and slow. Luckily, one of my uncles moved into our house for a while because he got a job in the city as a PhP developer. He had a PC that I could use. Most people around me didnâ€™t have any virtual social presence, and no one was bombarded with an insane amount of curated and unnecessary information.</description>

      <description>Diary of AOC 2022. This is my first time attempting AOC. My company had a private leaderboard, and I am competitive enough to take the bait. I chose python to solve the puzzles. I know many people use AOC as an opportunity to learn new languages, but I wanted to go with something familiar. I never used python in a professional setting, but I love using it for scripting and writing scrappy code.</description>
