      <description>I made an account on Orkut in 2009. In those days an internet connection was expensive and slow. Luckily, one of my uncles moved into our house for a while because he got a job in the city as a PhP developer. He had a PC that I could use. Most people around me didnâ€™t have any virtual social presence, and no one was bombarded with an insane amount of curated and unnecessary information.</description>

      <description>Diary of AOC 2022. This is my first time attempting AOC. My company had a private leaderboard, and I am competitive enough to take the bait. I chose python to solve the puzzles. I know many people use AOC as an opportunity to learn new languages, but I wanted to go with something familiar. I never used python in a professional setting, but I love using it for scripting and writing scrappy code.</description>

      <description>So What are Vector Dbs?
Vector Dbs are Databases that have native support to store and retrieve vector data. In Deep Learning everything is a vector -&amp;gt; Your inputs, weights, and your learned semantic space and embeddings. Vector Dbs can be used to store and retrieve these artifacts efficiently.
What is the right way of storing and retrieving these vectors? You typically want &amp;lsquo;Similar&amp;rsquo; vectors to be bunched together. Let&amp;rsquo;s define similarity as the distance between two vectors.</description>
